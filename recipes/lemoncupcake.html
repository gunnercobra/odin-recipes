    <h1>Lemon Cupcake</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Here is a recipe I use for beautifully delicious lemon cupcakes. Ideally, you'd use buttercream frosting to ice
        cupcakes, but I tried these with Lemon Cream Icing for a less buttery icing, and they were perfect! These
        cupcakes are truly lighter than air and will melt in your mouth.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups self-rising flour</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
        <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>4 eggs, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons lemon zest</li>
        <li>1 cup whole milk, divided</li>
        <li>2 ½ tablespoons fresh lemon juice, divided</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li> Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line 30 cupcake pan cups with paper liners.</li>
        <li> Sift the self-rising flour and salt together in a bowl. In another bowl, beat the unsalted butter and sugar
            with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, beating each egg until
            incorporated before adding the next. Mix in the vanilla extract and lemon zest.</li>
        <li> Gently beat the flour mixture into the butter mixture, one third at a time, alternating with half the milk
            and half the lemon juice after each of the first 2 additions of flour. Beat until just combined; do not over
            mix.</li>
        <li> Fill the prepared cupcake liners with batter 3/4 full, and bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick
            inserted in the center comes out clean, about 17 minutes. Let the cupcakes cool in the pans for about 10
            minutes before removing them to finish cooling on a rack.</li>
        <li> To make the icing, beat the cream in a chilled bowl with an electric mixer set on Low until the cream
            begins to thicken. Add the confectioners' sugar and lemon juice, a little at a time, beating after each
            addition, until fully incorporated. Increase the mixer speed to High, and beat until the icing forms soft
            peaks, about 5 minutes. Spread on the cooled cupcakes. Refrigerate leftovers.</li>
    </ol>
